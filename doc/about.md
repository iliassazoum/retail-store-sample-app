# About deploy.yaml

This is a Kubernetes manifest file that defines the deployment, service, and configuration for a retail store sample application. The application consists of several microservices, including catalog, carts, orders, assets, and checkout. Each microservice is deployed as a Kubernetes deployment with a corresponding service. The configuration for each microservice is stored in a ConfigMap. The UI microservice is also deployed as a deployment with a service and configuration stored in ConfigMaps. The application also includes a Redis cache for carts and orders. The manifest file also includes Prometheus metrics scraping for each microservice.
